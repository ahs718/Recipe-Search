# Recipe Search | Find the Perfect Recipe for Any Food

![Example gif](./img/example.gif)

- This website finds recipies using search queries from the [Edamam recipe search API](https://www.edamam.com).

- This website was built using [React](https://reactjs.org).

## My Experience Working on this Project

- This project is my first practical application of using React, and I wanted to make sure that my project could serve a real purpose. Interacting with data from APIs was therefore the focus of my attention, which led me to creating this Recipe Search website.

- I learned how to write code in React, which was at first confusing compared to HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. However, being able to group the three together allows for more interesting ways to organize a project, and I got hooked on it immediately! Aside of familiarizing myself with React, I also learned additional ways to use CSS to style the components that I created.
